QtFM, originally created by [Wittfella](http://www.qtfm.org/) in 2010, and further developed by [Michal Rost](http://qt-apps.org/content/show.php/QtFM?content=158787) in 2012 has now found a new home. Bugs will be fixed, code will be re-structured, and new features will be added. But still keeping it simple and lightweight.
